# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) API with TypeScript, Inversify, and Jest
This repository demonstrates how to build a scalable API using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with TypeScript, Inversify for dependency injection, and Jest for testing. The project provides a full implementation guide for setting up and running the API, implementing core services, and writing tests.

## Features
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for a clean and maintainable architecture.
- Inversify for powerful dependency injection and service management.
- Jest for comprehensive testing.
- Fully functional Express API with multiplication and summation endpoints.
